# How to Build an AI Product From Scratch

Most AI projects stall because requirements are vague and success metrics are missing. Teams chase accuracy without product context and ship experiences that fall apart under real usage.

This book is a practical guide to building AI products end-to-end. You’ll learn how to translate product requirements into model constraints, decide when fine-tuning is worth the cost, build evaluation harnesses that catch regressions, and assemble an agent that works in production. The running example is a sales email copilot, so every chapter ties back to real product choices.
