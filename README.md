# How to Build an AI Product From Scratch

Many AI initiatives fail to transition from promising demonstrations to reliable products. A common cause is the absence of explicit requirements and measurable success criteria; model selection is then driven by subjective impressions rather than product constraints.

This repository contains an mdBook-style manuscript describing a product-driven, model-agnostic procedure for building AI products end-to-end: constraints specification, model selection, fine-tuning decisions, evaluation harness construction, and production agent implementation.

A single running example is used throughout: an **academic research assistant** that answers literature questions with verifiable citations, supported by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), context engineering, knowledge-graph-based disambiguation and context expansion, targeted fine-tuning, and tool integrations for paper search and PDF parsing.
