# Project rules (How to Build an AI Product From Scratch)

## Canonical example
- Use the **Academic Research Assistant (RA)** as the sole running example across the book.

## Writing style
- Write in **scientific, impersonal academic English**.
- Avoid conversational voice; prefer explicit definitions, procedures, metrics, and limitations.
- Use **References** sections (not inline citation styles).

## Daily workflow (planning → approval → execution → review)
- By **12:00 Beijing time**: send a brief plan of (i) what will be written today and (ii) what build progress will be attempted. The plan should be guided by the manuscript blueprint and may cite inspiration sources (papers, technical blogs/docs, practitioner talks/videos). Proceed only after Mya approval.
- By **20:00 Beijing time**: deliver the day’s writing for review (chapter/section scoped), including a References section.

## Input workflow
- Mya provides ideas in pieces and may not follow chapter order.
- Capture raw input in `notes/inbox/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
- Integrate edited, publishable content into `book/src/...`.
- Request review only for **content changes**, not for purely formatting/organizational edits.

## Video-to-article workflow requirements
- If a video/link is provided, extract the transcript/content, distill key ideas, and draft an article section.
- The draft should be treated as an **abstracted note**: ordering and scope may be reorganized and expanded to improve logical flow and completeness.
- Always produce output in scientific styled English regardless of the source language.

## Reminder cadence
- If no update is received before **20:00 Beijing time**, send a reminder.
